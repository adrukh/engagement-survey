An Engagement Survey is a great way to measure the soft aspects of a successful organization. They are usually run across the company (but can be limited to a single org), and become relevant at a size of 20+ people. At this stage it is hard to rely on direct knowledge of people’s morale, and a systemic approach is needed.

Engagement Surveys should be simple, transparent, and have a meaningful impact on the company’s decisions in the future.

Start simple:
Agree on 3-5 core values that are key to the success of your company.
For each core value, create 3-5 questions that demonstrate how this value is manifested in the day-to-day of the company.
For example:
Value - one team / team work / collaboration
Questions:
It is easy for me to get help from my team members
I receive recognition when I help others succeed
…
Value - ship it / customer obsession / deliver value
Questions:
In our work, done is better than perfect
We value small increments over large projects
…
Good questions have a ‘yes/no’ structure, and will be focused on the responder. They state facts that the responder can agree or disagree with.
There needs to be a question similar to ‘I would love to recommend my friends to work at this company’ - this is the eNPS score.

Roll it out transparently:
Mix up the questions (no more than 40 total)
Each question can be answered with a number between 1 (strongly disagree) and 5 (strongly agree). 3 is a neutral answer, better to have it to make it easier to answer hard questions.
For every question, calculate the % of people who answered 4 or 5. This is the score of the question.
For every core value, calculate the average result of the questions for this value. This is the score of the value.
A high score (80%+) means that an important value is observed in the org
A low score (80%-) means that there is a gap between how important the value is to the management team, versus how rarely it is observed in the day-to-day in the org.
Share the value and question scores with the org, show what ranks on top (your strengths) and at the bottom (your weaknesses).
Explain how the score is calculated.

Take action after the survey:
Take the top 3 strong values, and celebrate them:
Recognize people demonstrating this
Use these values when attracting talent
Take the bottom 3 weak values, and work on them:
Ask leaders in your org to volunteer, investigate the source of the low score, and suggest steps to improve it
Run the survey every 3 to 6 months, and present the trendline
Are you keeping your strengths?
Are you improving on your weaknesses?
